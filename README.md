# tilebeard

Minimal package for implementing a WMTS with existing python networking framework, from tiles pre-rendered with tools like [gdal2tiles.py](http://www.gdal.org/gdal2tiles.html), or as a proxy to an existing WMTS with local caching.

Largely inspired by [TileStache](https://github.com/TileStache/TileStache)
